# Trains

Trains is a Javascript visualization of a simple train track.

## Idea

The idea came from [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/yannickbrouwer/status/1483531105999495174) showing an overview of all Dutch trains during a day.

I wanted to build a test version to see if I could turn it into a game.

## How it works

When you open the application and click "click here" it will display four trains sharing two tracks between two stations, changing tracks with two switches.

The next steps are to optimise how much trains we could get on these two tracks without collision. Then expand the number of stations, etc. These next steps are on hold.
